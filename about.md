# **Projects:** #

## Network Version 14 (NV14) ##
A project attempting to accurately visualize social structures within my year group. The only input is 'friendships' according to a poll conducted by 5 students in my year group. Nodes inputted into [Gephi](https://gephi.org), modelled with Yifan Hu Proportional model, and converted to website format with help from a Gephi plugin.   
Languages: `JavaScript` `Java` `SQL`  
Status: `completed`  
Links: [NV14](http://nv14.ga)  

## Network Version 18 (NV18) ##
A follow-up project of NV14, featuring updated friendships (accurate in Oct 2018) from a larger pool (100 students) and a more efficient edge generation methodology. Made with Gephi, modelled with Force Atlas 2, and available as downloadable images (currently).
Languages: `PHP` `SQL` `Git`

## Sign-in Project ##
A 6-month project to develop a late-slip dispenser and software, created in response to students' frustrated with the previous late arrivals sign-in system, which required them to wait on line to fill out a slip of paper, making them even later for class.  
Student scanned their ID card with a barcode scanner, they would be registered as late on a database, and a receipt printer would print a late-slip for them to bring to their teacher.
Despite a complete working product, the school was unwilling to give access to the student database. The project ended up acting as a proof of concept, and subsequently a catalyst for the school to retain a company to make a fully-fledged sign-in system with sliding doors and RFID.

## Portable Weather Data Logger (PWDL) ##
This project was completed for my Personal Project (International Baccalaureate), and inspired by my uncle & aunt, climatologists, who perform dozens of measurements every hour on their trips in the Peruvian Andes. Unfortunately they used analog instruments for each of these measurements, making the whole process highly time-consuming. My Weather Logger therefore served to fulfill this need by being able to record the many different atmospheric conditions, log them in a human-readable document, maps them (with GPS), perpetually, and with minimal input from the users.
Equipped with: GPS, barometer, altimeter, hygrometer, thermometer, UV sensor, external water temperature probe.  
Languages: `C++`

## Coding Club ##
Since my school doesn't offer formal coding classes, I decided to start the Coding Club with two friends of mine. I recruited roughly 12 students and taught them the fundamentals of website building, including JS, HTML, and CSS. I also acted as a mentor for students in younger grades working on coding projects for school. 

## MEAI (MemeEconomy Artificial Intelligence) ##
Collaboration with 3 students (two from UK, 1 from Germany) to create a [Reddit](https://reddit.com) bot. Uses database logging, tensorflow, python reddit API (PRAW).  
Languages: `Python`  
Version control: `Git` | `Bitbucket`  
Status: `in progress`

## Reddit image extractor script ##
An image scraper for Reddit that extracts up to 1000 images from a target subreddit and stores them in a local folder.

## Reddit text generator ##  
I built this toolkit on top of the fantastic TexGenRnn Python library, allowing for easier text generation training using inputs from the Reddit community.

## ASCII converter bot ##
Originally a simple programming exercise, this project is now so large that it is best described as two seperate parts:
1. An efficient and novel media converter from any video format into a gif/video created from only ASCII characters.
2. A Reddit bot created using PRAW which can be 'summoned' to convert a video submission into its ASCII equivalent. [still in progress]

# CS Experiences: #  

### CERN Internship ###  
I conducted a week-long internship at CERN with the web development and app development teams.  

### EPFL Robotics Course ###  
I participated in a week-long course in mobile robotics offered by the École Polytechinique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and hosted by Professor Francesco Mondada. We covered CS/robotics elements including control system programming, mapping/localization (SLAM), behavioral algorithms, and neural nets (RNNs).

### Student Council ###
* I was elected as one of 6 members of the student council (STUCO).
* Went to the annual BETT Techonology In Education conference in London as one of four representatives for my school.

### mHealth in Bangladesh ###
I joined an mHealth project in Bangladesh over a three week period under the supervision of Dr. Alain Labrique. I had the great experience of spending time with the coders at mPower in Dhaka, and then working with the rural JiVitA mobile health field project in Gaibandha. I primarily worked on developing video instructions for health workers on using mobile devices connected to the mPower medical registry system.
