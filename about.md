# **Projects:** #

## Network Version 14 (NV14) ##
A project attempting to accurately visualize social structures within my year group. The only input is 'friendships' according to a poll conducted by 5 students in my yeargroup. Nodes inputted into [Gephi](https://gephi.org), modelled with Yifan Hu Proportional model, and converted to website format with help from a Gephi plugin.   
Languages: `JavaScript` `Java` `SQL`  
Status: `completed`

## Sign-in project ##
A 6-month project to develop a late-slip dispenser and software.  
The student was able to scan their ID card with a barcode scanner, they would be registered as late on a database, and a receipt printer would print a late-slip for them to bring to their teacher.
Despite a complete working product, the school was unwilling to give access to the student database. The project ended up acting as a proof of concept, and subsequently a catalyst for the school to employ a company to make a fully-fledged sign-in system with sliding doors and RFID.
